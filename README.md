   Paper Tennis is an (abstract) strategic game for two players. The game field consists of 6 fields and a centre line (0).
   "These are called (-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3), with the negative numbers depicting player 1's side of the court, and the positive numbers being player 2's.
   At start, the ball is at the centre line (0). Both players start with the same amount of points (e.g. 50 points). 
   For each round, both players bid a number x (0<= x <=their total points) and the ball is moved towards the player with the lesser bid.
   Each round, the players' round score is decreased by their bid. 
   The game is over when either both players have 0 points or the ball reaches 3 (Player 1 wins) or -3 (Player 2 wins).
